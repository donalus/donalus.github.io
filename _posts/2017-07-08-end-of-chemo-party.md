Those of us that have experienced cancer, either by having it or by supporting
someone through it, know that cancer changes a lot. Daily/weekly/monthly trips
to medical stuff, frequent illness, fatigue, crankiness... it is a long list of
crap that piles on.

So, when that ends, it is worthy of a celebration. My girlfriend coordinated a
week long retreat to a house in Virginia with a big celebration party for the
end of chemo. Officially, I took my last pills the day after my niece was born,
April 8th. Not having to take ATRA again is a big improvement on my life.

Oh, and the party was amazing. Friends and family turned up in a really high
number and we were able to drink some beverages, eat some bbq, and enjoy a
really nice summer day.

There was also a really tasty cake.

And some delicious treats from Flying Monkey Bakery.
