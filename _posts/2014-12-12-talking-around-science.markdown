Maintaining a presence on the internet has always been a struggle for me. Throughout
the many iterations of social media, I have failed to be more than a consumer. There
have been fits and starts at a web presence over the years, but rarely have I made
it past the one or two fitful articles and the rather dull about me section.

The mission of this iteration is threefold:

 * To hold my CV
 * To reflect on articles
 * And to practice writing

An academic profession requires an incredible amount of writing and I've always found it
difficult to get started. Once started, I can easily burn through pages, but it is the
getting started part that always gets me. The internet generally agrees that the way to
move past this hang-up is to write -- to write a lot. Normally I would choose a more
private venue, but there is another component of academia that I need to acquaint myself
with: being public. A key component of a successful academic career is the ability to
talk about yourself and your research. Talking about your research is fun and exciting,
but talking about yourself is something that you are asked to do a lot and
is not a very comfortable thing to do.

This blog is not science, but it will talk about science, or rather, around science. By
this I mean that what I post may be my reflections around a topic, article, or
phenomena, but I make no assurances that I have gathered information to the point of
saturation or done rigorous theory building. What I write here will be early-stage, un-vetted,
uncorroborated, and, as will likely be discovered, poorly edited. As an idea develops, I may
discover that I do not like it very much or consider it correct. As such, there may be
contradictory posts and I am fine with this.

If you come across ideas that inspire or revolt you, then feel free to contact me.
I welcome constructive input and enjoy hearing alternative perspectives.

Oh, and my CV is coming. They are just really irritating documents to create.
