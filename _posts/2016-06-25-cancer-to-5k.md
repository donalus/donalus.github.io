Being sick sucks and cancer is the perfect storm of sick. Recovering from
it is an interesting experience because you think: "now I am healthy." Then
your body laughs in your face. It is frustrating and disheartening. But, there
are some pretty great organizations out there to help. The Ulman Cancer Fund
has a program called "Cancer to 5k" that brings volunteers and cancer survivors
together to train for a race. This is a great way to meet people and get back
into your body after treatment.

One thing to note, many of the volunteers are survivors themselves. Not all,
but a good number. Other volunteers have either been affected directly by
cancer or have been brought in some other way.

As a survivor participant, it is a really great program. This was my first race
with them. As you can see, I was running at the end of it, but I was definitely
walking at the start. Immediately after leaving the hospital after my 35-day
stay, I could barely walk a mile, much less run.

I've also made some great friends. (Not all of whom have cancer.)
