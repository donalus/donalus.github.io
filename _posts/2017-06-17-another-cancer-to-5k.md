Yup, I did it again. I spent several months running with a great group of
people in another Ulman Cancer Fund Cancer to 5k group. Some familiar faces,
but plenty of new this time round. I ran a little faster, even though I didn't
really run between the last time and the start of this training period.

This is my last time as a participant. Next year I plan on being a Sherpa. That
just means that instead of having my water bottle carried for me, I get to
carry it for someone else. Should be fun!
