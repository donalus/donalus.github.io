A lot should have happened by now. I should be the architect for software being
developed by an awesome company. I should have published some great articles. I
should have defended my dissertation proposal and be working on my
dissertation. That was the plan.

The reality has been different. A year ago, I started feeling very poorly.
It was probably more than a year ago, but it was gradual and there was a lot
going on so I only really noticed when something was drastically wrong. And
something was drastically wrong. I couldn't walk across the room without
getting out of breath, I would wake up in the middle of the night soaked with
sweat, and I was bruising easily. My gums started to bleed... All signs you
should see a doctor pretty darn quickly.

A trip to urgent care resulted in an ambulance ride to the hospital. As my
phone started to die I managed to get my room number to my sister and the name
of the hospital to my girlfriend. Once they arrived they noticed the signs that
said oncology, but even after spending the night in the hospital I didn't know
why I was there.

In less than a day, I was diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia. I had
checked into the hospital without an immune system, no red blood cells to speak
of, and no platelets. Thirty-five days go in the hospital getting a combination
of Arsenic Trioxide and ATRA during what is called "Induction Therapy." That
was followed by eight months of "Consolidation Therapy." Now it is a year of
"Maintenance Therapy."

Fortunately, I have a very kind and caring girlfriend who helped a ton during
this period. My sister was able to help a lot, too. Some really wonderful
people at my mom's work had a bake sale and I was able to use that money for
gas to get to my infusions. My department and advisor were incredibly
supportive and understanding. I am immensely grateful to be alive and to have
received so much kindness throughout this ordeal.

So, it is all over right? Nope. Cancer's shadow hangs around. You are
permanently changed in ways unfathomable before. Every experience is unique,
mileage does vary. Peripheral neuropathy make hands tingle and feet hurt.
I have found running to help in combination with the medications. My brain full
of mud. Imagine spraining your ankle and having to walk around in a splint, but
it is my brain. Some of it was a B12 deficiency. Some of it seems to be helped
by some other meds. Backing off the meds for the neuropathy seems to be helping
too. Oh, and I am tired. But, I will adapt and things will get better.

Better than being dead.

So progress slowed down a little bit, but things are starting to move again and
I am very excited for that to happen. The projects I am working on are
exciting and I can't wait for them to move forward and get published.
