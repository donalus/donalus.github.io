# A New Wealth of Data Cleaning Tools

This should start with "back in my day" in order to convey a curdgeony feeling towards 
new-fangled tools that allow us to clean data more easily. The problem that approach is 
that these new tools are amazing. They allow us to prepare data for analysis more safely, 
quickly, repeatably, and reliably. 

These are the tools I have currenlty experimented with:
* OpenRefine: [openrefine.org](https://openrefine.org/)
* Trifacta Wrangler: [trifacta.com](https://www.trifacta.com/)
* Tableau Prep: [tableau.com](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep)

Before I was introduced to OpenRefine, I would immediate reach for Python, Scala, or 
some other nice language for building a pipeline to transform the data. In the class 
on data prep that I've developed and taught, I start with Python and Pandas and run 
the gambit through all the various sources of data that you are likely to encounter
with the goal of creating a data set that can be analyzed. Of course, this process
is the similar to building an ETL workflow.

Once we are familar with looking for incorrect data types, using RegEx to transform 
strings, and generally familiar with looking at data and trying to figure out what 
questions it can answer and the best format for it to be in to answer those 
questions.

I, naturally, started with the unscientific statistic that 80% of a data scientists, 
but it takes a bit before the students are onboard with the idea that this class 
represents the bulk of the work rather than the flashy visualization class or the 
statistics and machine learning classes. It just boils down to the garbage-in; 
garbage-out principle. The more effort you put into preparing the data, the better 
your results will be.

But, I am singing to the choir, right? You came here to learn about the new data 
cleaning tools that are starting to appear. As I complete my reviews of the 
tools listed above, I will add links to the reviews below.
