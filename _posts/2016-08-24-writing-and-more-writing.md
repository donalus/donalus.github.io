Getting a PhD and being an academic requires writing and writing isn't
something that I am terribly good at. I used to think I was, but now it feels
like a slog. So how do I fix this?

The answer is that I write. I write a lot. And... I get someone to hold me
accountable, preferably in a way that also benefits them. I now have a fellow
PhD student that also needs to write and so through mutual harassment we will
keep ourselves on track and putting words on the page.

This is my list of things that I need to write:
- dissertation proposal
- a design method paper for a project
- that novel I keep writing notes about
- the rules to the game that I just jotted down in my notebook
- the two journal papers that my integrative paper needs to become

Probably should stop writing here then and move on to those other things, but I
have made it a goal to update this site more often. I am hoping that will help
with my writing. I doubt that it will hurt.
