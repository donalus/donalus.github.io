excerpt: Plans are how we make sense of the past.

A lot should have happened by now. I should be architecting awesome software for a great company. I should have written some great articles. I should have defended my disertation proposal and be working on my disertation. That was the plan.

The reality has been very different. A year ago, I started feeling very poorly. It was  more than a year ago, but it was gradual and there was a lot going on so I only really noticed when something was drastically wrong. And something was drastically wrong. I couldn't walk across the room without getting out of breath, I would wake up in the middle of the night soked with sweat, and I was bruising easily. My gums started to bleed more than they should if you brush your teeth or floss too hard.

A trip to urgent care resulted in an ambulance ride to the hospital. As my phone started to die I managed to get my room number to my sister and the name of the hospital to my girlfriend. Once they arrived they noticed the signs that said oncology, but even after spending the night in the hospital I didn't know why I was there.

I was diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia. Basically the stem cells that turn into a type of white blood cell decide that they are Toys R Us kids and don't want to grow up. They fill the bone marrow and no other blood cells can be made. I had checked into the hospital without and immune system, no red blood cells to speak of, and no platelets (remember the bleeding gums?). Thirty-five days go by with me in the hospital getting chemo every day. Chemo was a combination of Arsenic Trioxide and ATRA (All-trans retinoic acid). The arsenic tells the bad cells that it is time to die and the ATRA tells the cells that will listen to differentiate (ie grow-up). That first round of treatment is called "Induction Therapy" because it induces remission. Then there was the eight months of "Consolidation Therapy" that was an alternating schedule of four weeks of Arsenic and four weeks off with a coinciding two week on two week off schedule for ATRA. Now it is a year of "Maintenance Therapy", which is only ATRA in alternating weeks... I could have done two weeks every three months for two years, but that sounds like a recipe for forgetting. Also, I draw the line at two years of treatment.

Fortunately I have a very kind and caring girlfriend who helped a ton during this period. And my sister was able to help a lot, too. Also some really wonderful people at my mom's work had a bake sale and I was able to use that money for gas to get to my infusions. My department and advisor were incredibly suppportive and understanding. I am immensely grateful to be alive and to have recieved so much kindness and help.

So, it is all over right? Nope. Cancer's shadow hangs around. You are permanently changed in ways you unfathomable before. Every experience is unique, so your mileage may vary. I have peripheral neuropathy which makes my feet and hands tingle and sharp pains in my feet. Running helps the feet and I am on medications to help manage it. Oh, and then there is my brain. It is full of mud. Imagine spraining your ankle and having to walk around in a splint. Then imagine that your brain. I don't know if it is all the medications I am on or if it is a result of the chemo or a result of being seriously oxygen starved for a while, but I am having to learn how to be productive as an academic with a completely different brain. I think I am figuring it out. I just managed to write a bunch of words, which is a start. It has been hard for me to write. 

Better than being dead.

And the world needs more applied ethicists, or failing that, we need to get engineering students to realize that technical problems are social problems, so the squishy stuff matters. Someone has to do it and seems like I signed up to be one of those people.
