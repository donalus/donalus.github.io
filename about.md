I am a PhD candidate in the [College of Information Studies] at the 
[University of Maryland]. I have a MS in Information Systems from 
[UMBC] and a BA in Philosophy from [Ripon College]. I have also spent 
a decade in industry filling a variety of technical roles 
including technical writer, programmer, team lead, software architect, 
and product manager. 

I am a member of the [Ethics and Values in Design lab] that my advisor 
[Associate Professor Katie Shilton] leads. I also belong to the 
[Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information (CASCI)] 
and [Information Policy and Access Center (iPAC)].

My research interests draw on my background as a professional technologist 
and a student of philosophy to develop an understanding of how distributed 
groups navigate ethics and values issues and decision making. My dissertation
focusses on actualizing research within the values and design space into 
curricular interventions targeting undergraduate engineering students. The 
goal is to create learning modules that engage students in ethics and values 
discussions and decision-making.
