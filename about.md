My professional career has
included many different technical roles including training developer, technical
writer, programmer, software architect, and product manager.

At the [Ethics and Values in Design lab], I
researched how to provide current and future
designers of emergent technologies with tools and frameworks for navigating
discussions and decision-making surrounding ethical challenges. 

Oh, and I survived [Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia].

I enjoy outdoor activities, like biking, hiking, and rock climbing. I also
make electronics stuff. Mostly I try to keep this focused around my
[Amateur Radio] hobby where I have a general class license with the call K3CUU.
Often I get a little distracted and end up building weird useless things with
blinky lights.
