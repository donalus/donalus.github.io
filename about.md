I am currently a PhD candidate in the [College of Information Studies] at the
[University of Maryland]. I have a MS in Information Systems from
[UMBC] and a BA in Philosophy from [Ripon College]. My professional career has
included many different technical roles including technical writer, programmer,
 software architect, and product manager.

I am a member of the [Ethics and Values in Design lab] that my advisor
Associate Professor [Katie Shilton] leads. I also belong to the
[Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information (CASCI)]
and [Information Policy and Access Center (iPAC)].

My research attempts to understand how to provide current and future
designers of emergent technologies with tools and frameworks for navigating
discussions and decision-making surrounding ethical challenges. I am currently
focusing on the development of educational interventions for both college
classrooms and professional workshops.  

Oh, yeah. I am a cancer survivor (Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia).
