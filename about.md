I am a PhD student in the [College of Information Studies] at the 
[University of Maryland]. I have a MS in Information Systems from 
[UMBC] and a BA in Philosophy from [Ripon College]. Before starting 
my PhD, I spent a decade in industry in a variety of technical roles 
including technical writer, programmer, team lead, and product manager. 

I participate in the "Values in Design" group that my advisor 
[Assistant Professor Katie Shilton] leads and I am a Junior Fellow in the 
[Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information (CASCI)].

My research interests draw on my background as a professional technologist 
and a student of philosophy to develop an understanding of how distributed 
digital communities navigate ethics and values issues. I am currently focusing
on the communities surrounding open source software projects and how ethics 
discourse affects material change.
