The common thread throughout my career has been data. I spent time in industry as a 
developer, training engineer, and project manager. I've always enjoyed working to get answers 
out of datasets, whether that was keeping track of budgets in Excel or writing SQL queries 
to generate reports. I am now interested in exploring the many techniques that can be 
used to prepare data prior to analysis.

I am currently a data engineer at a non-profit and adjunct instructor in the 
[College of Information][info] at the University of Maryland.

I have a BA in Philosophy from [Ripon College][ripon] and a MS in 
Information Systems from [UMBC][umbc].

## Cancer

I am a survivor of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia. Besides the support of my family 
and partner, I was also personally helped through this journey by these organizations:
 - [Ulman Foundation](https://ulmanfoundation.org/)
 - [First Descents](https://firstdescents.org/)

I did not directly receive help from [Leukemia & Lymphoma Society](https://www.lls.org/), 
but it is through their research support that APL is so survivable. I would love for all 
cancers to be as treatable.
