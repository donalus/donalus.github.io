I"#<p>The common thread throughout my career has been data. I spent time in industry as a 
developer, training engineer, and project manager. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed working to get answers 
out of datasets, whether that was keeping track of budgets in Excel or writing SQL queries 
to generate reports. I am now interested in exploring the many techniques that can be 
used to prepare data prior to analysis.</p>

<p>I am currently a data engineer at a non-profit and adjunct instructor in the 
<a href="https://info.umd.edu">College of Information</a> at the University of Maryland.</p>

<p>I have a BA in Philosophy from <a href="https://www.ripon.edu">Ripon College</a> and a MS in 
Information Systems from <a href="https://informationsystems.umbc.edu">UMBC</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cancer">Cancer</h2>

<p>I am a survivor of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia. Besides the support of my family 
and partner, I was also personally helped through this journey by these organizations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ulmanfoundation.org/">Ulman Foundation</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://firstdescents.org/">First Descents</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I did not directly receive help from <a href="https://www.lls.org/">Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</a>, 
but it is through their research support that APL is so survivable. I would love for all 
cancers to be as treatable.</p>
