title:  "Living Free: Going GNU with Linux"
categories: computing freedom dogfood
excerpt: Several years ago I had caught the Linux bug quite severely and was running as my primary system on both my work and personal machines. Then I decided to try drinking the FSF koolaid and going full-free GNU/Linux and running gNewSense. It was a short-lived experiment. I have decided to try this experiment again and for 2015 to run Trisquel GNU/Linux on my main work machine.

For those readers of Gabriella Coleman's book [Coding Freedom][1], my nerd coming-of-age story reads like many from the
dawn of the millennia: College provided me with my first always-on connection and from there
I fell madly in love with computing. It was not long before the forums I frequented introduced me 
to IRC and IRC introduced me to Linux. I have never been without access to a Linux system since
then - either on my machine itself or through ssh. 

Throughout my fifteen years of Linux use, I have always fallen more on the Open rather than the
Free side of the FLOSS political spectrum. Around 2008, I briefly flirted with gNewSense. 
That experience was far from pleasant and was relatively short-lived. I didn't feel any regret 
as I installed the newly released Windows 7 on the gaming machine I just built and quietly set 
aside the gNewSense laptop to rot in my closet.

Now years later, I find myself a qualitative researcher focusing on people's values and ethics as 
they relate to computing and information. With a growing desperation surrounding my need to 
focus while on my computing device and being susceptible to the [solutionist trap][2], I
started considering buying a "cheap" chromebook and turning it into a "typewriter" by installing
just the bare minimum that I need to write. During my research I came across a couple articles:
  * *Phoronix*'s article on the FSF-approved X60 that [suggests the C720][3] as an alternative
  * that author's description of the experience on the [C720 as a Linux machine][4]
  * *the_unconventional*'s blog post describing [installing Debian][5] on a Chromebook
  * and the [following post][6] on re-flashing the bios to use coreboot
