The increasing reach of technology has moved pervasive computing from the 
realm of science fiction to reality. Technology is being designed to 
influence behavior. Borders between work and personal time are blurred, 
denied, or rejected. User-facing software is often the vestige of larger 
underlying system with goals of its own. Designers are challenged to 
design systems when the answers to questions of who, when, where and even 
what cannot be easily answered. New technical challenges once thought 
insurmountable find solutions every day, but the social concerns are pushed 
aside, either perceived as impractical or viewed as a concern for someone 
external to the design team. My interests align with the increasing number 
of researchers that make the claim that these social issues are the concern 
of designers.  

My research goal is to understand the social contexts of systems, to 
identify practical solutions for designers of systems to address potential 
concerns, and to ask what it means to build systems ethically. I frame this 
pursuit with the perspective that designers and users interact with systems 
in distinct social contexts that include the values each group holds. When 
the values held by designers and users do not align, issues arise ranging 
from public outrage, disenfranchisement of classes of users, or the rejection 
of the system. Understanding the context of design requires understanding the 
role of the organization versus the role of the individual in relation to the 
values and influence that each bring to the design process. The context of use 
is dualistic comprising the ex-ante context of how the user is captured during 
the design process and the ex-post of the actual individuals using the system.

In the coursework I have completed my focus has been on exploring the idea 
of a discursive model of system design. I proposed a means of understanding 
the interactions of software developers on open source projects to identify 
how the teams address social concerns. Social Network Analysis of project 
repositories can identify how the project organically forms topical teams 
based on interest and ability. The SNA methods can also show the central 
players within and between these teams within the project, which will be 
 to guide the qualitative exploration of project artifacts like conversations 
 within message lists and tickets within bug tracking or project management 
 systems to identify how values are discussed and actualized. Toward this goal, 
 I wrote a [tool](https://github.com/donalus/git-adjacency-list-tool), to analyze 
 repositories and create an adjacency list for analysis in 
 [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and am now working to convert the tool into an 
 extension of [CVSAnalY](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY) to gain 
 support for multiple repository providers. While the individual pieces of 
 the puzzle have been identified, the research itself has yet to be realized 
 as a whole. Open source projects represent more than a convenient sample; 
 open source is a value-laden enterprise where both users and designers may 
 be more likely to explicitly discuss certain value or sets of values.

Further research will investigate how users perceive systems to understand the 
ex-post context of use and how it may differ from the ex-ante context that the 
designers envisioned. While there have been many public cases of users 
disagreeing with values surrounding the design of a system (for example concern 
of privacy in Facebook), the ex-ante vision of the user is locked behind closed 
doors and design team values can only be guessed. Research addressing this area 
will have to consider the intent of the designers as well as the perceptions of 
the users in order to develop a comprehensive understanding.
