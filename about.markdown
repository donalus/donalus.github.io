## About Me

I am very happy to be a Lecturer at the [College of Information Studies][ischool], 
[University of Maryland][umd]. For those unfamiliar with UMD's academic titles, lecturer 
is part of the professional faculty track at UMD. Professional track faculty are 
full-time faculty positions that do not lead to tenure. Lecturer is in the teaching 
track, which means that the primary focus is teaching and learning.

Before being becoming as a lecturer, I spent time in industry as a software developer, 
training engineer, and project manager. I've always enjoyed working to get answers 
out of datasets, whether that was keeping track of budgets in Excel or writing SQL queries 
to generate reports. I am now interested in exploring the many techniques that can be 
used to prepare data prior to analysis.

I have a BA in Philosophy from [Ripon College][ripon] and a MS in 
Information Systems from [UMBC][umbc].

### Dogs

I am a dog person. These are my dogs, Duke and Hammond. Duke came with my partner and 
Hammond is a foster that we couldn't give up. They are both rescues, so we don't know 
why they are so pretty.

### Cancer

I am a cancer survivor. After 35 days in the hospital and nearly 2 years of chemo, I am in 
remission for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia. Besides the support of my family and partner, 
I was also personally helped through this journey by these organizations:
 - [Ulman Foundation](https://ulmanfoundation.org/)
 - [First Descents](https://firstdescents.org/)

While I did not directly receive help from 
[Leukemia & Lymphoma Society](https://www.lls.org/), it in part through their  
support of research that APL is so survivable. I would love for all cancers to be 
as treatable.
